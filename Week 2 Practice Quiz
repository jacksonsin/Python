Practice Quiz: Functions

Question 1
This function converts miles to kilometers (km).

Complete the function to return the result of the conversion
Call the function to convert the trip distance from miles to kilometers
Fill in the blank to print the result of the conversion
Calculate the round-trip in kilometers by doubling the result, and fill in the blank to print the result

Ans:
# 1) Complete the function to return the result of the conversion
def convert_distance(miles):
	km = miles * 1.6  # approximately 1.6 km in 1 mile
	return km

my_trip_miles = 55

# 2) Convert my_trip_miles to kilometers by calling the function above
my_trip_km = convert_distance(my_trip_miles)

# 3) Fill in the blank to print the result of the conversion
print("The distance in kilometers is " + str(my_trip_km))

# 4) Calculate the round-trip in kilometers by doubling the result,
#    and fill in the blank to print the result
print("The round-trip in kilometers is " + str(my_trip_km*2))

Question 2
This function compares two numbers and returns them in increasing order.

Fill in the blanks, so the print statement displays the result of the function call in order.
Hint: if a function returns multiple values, don't forget to store these values in multiple variables

Ans:
# This function compares two numbers and returns them
# in increasing order.
def order_numbers(number1, number2):
	if number2 > number1:
		return number1, number2
	else:
		return number2, number1

# 1) Fill in the blanks so the print statement displays the result
#    of the function call
smaller, bigger = order_numbers(100, 99)
print(smaller, bigger)

Question 3
What are the values passed into functions as input called?

Ans: Parameters

Question 4
Let's revisit our lucky_number function. We want to change it, so that instead of printing the message, it returns the message. This way, the calling line can print the message, or do something else with it if needed. Fill in the blanks to complete the code to make it work.

Ans:
def lucky_number(name):
  number = len(name) * 9
  message = "Hello " + name + ". Your lucky number is " + str(number)
  return message
	    
print(lucky_number("Kay"))
print(lucky_number("Cameron"))

Question 5
What is the purpose of the def keyword?

Ans: Used to define a new function


Practice Quiz: Expressions and Variables

Question 1
In this scenario, two friends are eating dinner at a restaurant. The bill comes in the amount of 47.28 dollars. The friends decide to split the bill evenly between them, after adding 15% tip for the service. Calculate the tip, the total amount to pay, and each friend's share, then output a message saying "Each person needs to pay: " followed by the resulting number.

Ans:
bill = 47.28
tip = bill * 0.15
total = bill + tip
share = total / 2 
print("Each person needs to pay: " + str(share))

Question 2
This code is supposed to take two numbers, divide one by another so that the result is equal to 1, and display the result on the screen. Unfortunately, there is an error in the code. Find the error and fix it, so that the output is correct.

Ans: 
numerator = 10
denominator = 10
result = numerator / denominator
print(result)

Question 3
Combine the variables to display the sentence "How do you like Python so far?"

Ans: 
word1 = "How "
word2 = "do "
word3 = "you "
word4 = "like "
word5 = "Python "
word6 = "so "
word7 = "far?"

print(word1 + word2 + word3 + word4 + word5 + word6 + word7)

Question 4
This code is supposed to display "2 + 2 = 4" on the screen, but there is an error. Find the error in the code and fix it, so that the output is correct.

1 / 1 point

Ans: print("2 + 2 = " + str(2 + 2))

Question 5
What do you call a combination of numbers, symbols, or other values that produce a result when evaluated?

Ans: An expression


Practice Quiz: Conditionals

Question 1
What's the value of this Python expression: (2**2) == 4?

Ans: True

Question 2
Complete the script by filling in the missing parts. The function receives a name, then returns a greeting based on whether or not that name is "Taylor".

Ans:
def greeting(name):
  if name == "Taylor":
    return "Welcome back Taylor!"
  else:
    return "Hello there, " + name

print(greeting("Taylor"))
print(greeting("John"))

Question 3
Whatâ€™s the output of this code if number equals 10?

Ans:
if number > 11: 
  print(0)
elif number != 10:
  print(1)
elif number >= 20 or number < 12:
  print(2)
else:
  print(3)

Question 4
Is "A dog" smaller or larger than "A mouse"? Is 9999+8888 smaller or larger than 100*100? Replace the plus sign in the following code to let Python check it for you and then answer.

print("A dog" < "A mouse")
print(9999+8888 > 100*100)

Ans: "A dog" is smaller than "A mouse"  and 9999+8888 is larger than 100*100

Question 5
If a filesystem has a block size of 4096 bytes, this means that a file comprised of only one byte will still use 4096 bytes of storage. A file made up of 4097 bytes will use 4096*2=8192 bytes of storage. Knowing this, can you fill in the gaps in the calculate_storage function below, which calculates the total number of bytes needed to store a file of a given size?

Ans:
def calculate_storage(filesize):
    block_size = 4096
    # Use floor division to calculate how many blocks are fully occupied
    full_blocks = filesize // block_size
    # Use the modulo operator to check whether there's any remainder
    partial_block_remainder = filesize % block_size
    # Depending on whether there's a remainder or not, return
    # the total number of bytes required to allocate enough blocks
    # to store your data.
    if partial_block_remainder > 0:
        return block_size * round(filesize / block_size + 0.5)
    return block_size

print(calculate_storage(1))    # Should be 4096
print(calculate_storage(4096)) # Should be 4096
print(calculate_storage(4097)) # Should be 8192
print(calculate_storage(6000)) # Should be 8192
