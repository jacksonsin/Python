Why does this code raise an error:
print("1234"+5678)

Ans: Because Python doesn't know how to add a number to a string.

"""
Exercise - Variables
"""
Now, it's your turn to give it a try!

Fill in the blanks to calculate the area of a triangle of base 5, height 3 and output the result. 
Reminder: the area of a triangle is (base*height)/2.

base = 5
height = 3
area = (base * height)/2

print(area)

"""
Exercise - Expressions, Numbers, and Type Conversions
"""
Practice writing some expressions and conversions yourself.

In this scenario, we have a directory with 5 files in it. 
Each file has a different size: 2048, 4357, 97658, 125, and 8. 
Fill in the blanks to calculate the average file size by having Python add all the values for you, 
and then set the files variable to the number of files. 
Finally, output a message saying "The average size is: " followed by the resulting number. 
Remember to use the str() function to convert the number into a string.

total = 2048 + 4357 + 97658 + 125 + 8
files = 5
average = total / files
print("The average size is:" + str(average))

"""
Exercise - Defining Functions
"""
Do you think you can flesh out your own function? I think you can! Letâ€™s give it a go.

Flesh out the body of the print_seconds function so that it prints the total amount of seconds given the hours, minutes, and seconds function parameters. 
Remember that there are 3600 seconds in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute.

def print_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds):
    print(hours*3600 + minutes*60 + seconds)

print_seconds(1,2,3)

"""
Exercise - Returning Values
"""
Use the get_seconds function to work out the amount of seconds in 2 hours and 30 minutes, then add this number to the amount of seconds in 45 minutes and 15 seconds. 
Then print the result.

def get_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds):
  return 3600*hours + 60*minutes + seconds

amount_a = get_seconds(2,0,0)
amount_b = get_seconds(0,30,0)
amount_c = get_seconds(0,45,0)
amount_d = get_seconds(0,0,15)
result = amount_a + amount_b + amount_c + amount_d 
print(result)

"""
Exercise - The Principles of Code Reuse
"""
Ready to try it yourself? See if you can reduce the code duplication in this script.

In this code, identify the repeated pattern and replace it with a function called month_days, 
that receives the name of the month and the number of days in that month as parameters. 
Adapt the rest of the code so that the result is the same. 
Confirm your results by making a function call with the correct parameters for both months listed.

# REPLACE THIS STARTER CODE WITH YOUR FUNCTION
def month_days(month, days):
    print(month + " has " + str(days) + " days.")

month_days("june",30)
month_days("july",31)

"""
Exercise - Code Style
"""
This function to calculate the area of a rectangle is not very readable. 
Can you refactor it, and then call the function to calculate the area with base of 5 and height of 6? 
Tip: a function that calculates the area of a rectangle should probably be called rectangle_area, 
and if it's receiving base and height, that's what the parameters should be called.

def rectangle_area(base,height):
	area = base*height  # the area is base*height
	print("The area is " + str(area))
rectangle_area(5,6)
